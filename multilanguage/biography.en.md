Ziyan is a full stack developer and a researcher.

Ziyan devotes himself to making programming languages and tools better. Specifically, he wants to simplify the way people learn programming and the way developers work, by designing and implementing safe general-purpose and domain-specific languages with high development productivity and diverse programming paradigms.

Why? One of the reasons: it's Ziyan's observation that a large proportion of software defects, i.e. bugs and vulnerabilities, though seemingly nothing more than run-of-the-mill errors in code, can be ultimately traced back to the underlying design flaws of languages. He believes that a well-designed language eliminates such defects at the very root, far before developers start coding.

However, Ziyan understands that proposing novel languages may be too ambitious, running the risk of not seeing real use. He thus makes a compromise to also adopt program analysis and compiler optimization as practical ways to improve code written in existing flawed languages.
