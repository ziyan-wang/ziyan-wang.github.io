  <h1>Dependence Minimization Lifestyle</h1>
  <p>
    The dependence minimization lifestyle requires people to depend as little as possible on other people and things, either mentally or physically.
  </p>
  <p>
    It does not mean one should suppress all their desires; rather, one should exploit them as the drive for progress. People are advised to learn and acquire the necessary skills to fulfill their desires from scratch on their own. As human desire grows unchecked, people need to learn new things constantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ultimate and ideal goal is to become a person who masters most human knowledge and skills, who survives catastrophes, who restores human civilization even if it is destroyed â€” the strongest person in the world, both mentally and physically.
