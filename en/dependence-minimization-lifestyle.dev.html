  <h1>Dependence Minimization Lifestyle<sup>*</sup></h1>
  <p>
    The dependence minimization lifestyle (aka the minimum survival principle) requires people to depend as little as possible on external resources, either materially or spiritually. External resources include but are not limited to property, goods and materials, energy resources, services, and people.
  </p>
  <p>
    In dependence minimization lifestyle, knowledge is the only thing people can depend on without limit. The ideal goal is to become a person who masters most human knowledge and skills.
