                       Dependence Minimization Lifestyle

The dependence minimization lifestyle requires people to depend as little as
possible on other people and things, either mentally or physically.

It does not mean one should suppress all their desires; rather, one should
exploit them as the drive for progress. People are advised to learn and acquire
the necessary skills to fulfill their desires from scratch on their own. As
human desire grows unchecked, people need to learn new things constantly.

The ultimate goal is to become a person who masters almost all human knowledge
and skills, who survives catastrophes, who restores human civilization even if
it is destroyed â€” the strongest person in the world, both mentally and
physically.
