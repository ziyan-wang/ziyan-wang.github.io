                      Dependence Minimization Lifestyle

The dependence minimization lifestyle requires people to depend as little as
possible on other people and things, either mentally or physically.

It does not mean one should suppress all their desires; rather, people are
advised to learn and acquire the necessary skills to fulfill the desires on
their own from scratch. As their desires grow unbounded, people will need to
learn new things constantly. The ultimate goal of this lifestyle is to become
a person who masters all human knowledge and skills, who survives in
catastrophes, who restores human civilization even if completely destroyed â€”
the strongest person in the world, both mentally and physically.
