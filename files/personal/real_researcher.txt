                   THE REAL RESEARCHER

By now, I'm a researcher with integrity.

Unfortunately, in a corrupted environment, I'm afraid my
personality won't last long - the worst is yet to come.

Please report me to the authorities or expose me to the
public if you find me involved in any academic misconduct.
