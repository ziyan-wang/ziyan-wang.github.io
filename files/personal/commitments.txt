                  COMMITMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS

I am:
  - a self-motivated student with a strong interest and talent
    in programming languages (static analysis and compilers)
  - both a "hacker" with solid engineering backgrounds and a
    "thinker" who comes with new ideas and insights
  - a person who spends his life seeking the ultimate truths
    and the consummate skills

I hope you:
  - are serious about your researches and produce original works
  - stand in the front line of either academia or industry
  - respect your PhD students and instruct them in person
